# du-week-2-portfolio-homework

In this project I created a responsive web application that will allow others to know a little bit about me, see what skills I have, and contact me. I did this to test how well I could use Bootstrap's CSS Framework and so that I could begin a portfolio that I could use in the future once I am ready to begin my career.

I created this web application by first creating the three different htmls; contact.html, index.html (this contains the About Me), and portfolio.html. From there I started simple by linking Bootstrap, changing the title then working my way down the page. Once the first html file was complete it made the other two easier and faster to create.

Throughout the entirety of this project I did come across many challenges some small such as picking a nav bar to some that took me hours to figure out like making a sticky footer. This project also allowed me to work with margins and padding to the point that I understand them much better. Of course, there are still a few things a need to practice when it comes to positioning elements (relative, absolute, static).

The fact that this is the first functional web application motivated me because I cannot wait to see my progress through out the course. I know that this portfolio will change a lot within the next few months. I plan to practice with more position properties so that my portfolio looks better and cleaner in the future.
